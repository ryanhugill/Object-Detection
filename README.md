Object Detection
========================================================================================================================

What is this code?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is the implementation of object detection in Python using the Haar Cascade Algorithm. 

This code can quickly be changed to detect objects in either images, video or a camera's live video feed.

The code can also quickly be changed to detect different types of object provided you have a trained object detection
model for the object you wish to detect already made (otherwise you will need to make one).

I have uploaded a short demo of this code detecting faces from my webcam onto YouTube here:
